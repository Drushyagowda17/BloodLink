## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher  
- PowerShell 7.0+ on Windows (optional)  
- Virtual environment is optional  

### 1) Clone or Download
```bash
# Using git
git clone https://github.com/Drushyagowda17/BloodLink.git
cd BloodLink

# Or download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it
2) Install Dependencies

Recommended (if requirements.txt is present):
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install flask
python -m pip install flask_sqlalchemy
python -m pip install flask_bcrypt
python -m pip install flask_login
3) (Optional) Configure Settings in Code

Open app.py and adjust constants/settings as needed, for example:

SECRET_KEY

HOSPITAL_CODES (comma-separated list)

Chatbot provider/API key variables (if used)

For learning/demo use, in-code configuration is fine. For production, move secrets to a secure store or environment variables managed by the host.

Configuration
Application Settings (in code)

SECRET_KEY – Flask secret key for sessions

HOSPITAL_CODES – Comma-separated list of valid hospital codes

Chatbot provider/API key – if the medical assistant feature is enabled

Database

SQLite database is created automatically on first run

No migrations required – tables are created using SQLAlchemy

Database file: bloodlink.db

Customization

Themes – Edit CSS variables in static/css/styles.css

Languages – Add translation files in static/i18n/

Hospital Codes – Update the list in app.py

Chatbot – Configure provider/key in app.py or a small config.py

Security Features

Password Security – bcrypt hashing with salt

Session Management – Secure session handling via Flask-Login

Data Privacy – Role-based access control

Input Validation – Server-side and client-side validation

CSRF Protection – Handled via Flask patterns

For real deployments, harden configuration, rotate keys, use TLS (HTTPS), and apply proper secrets management.

Browser Support

Features Used – ES6+, CSS Grid, Flexbox, Local Storage

Troubleshooting

Database not created

Ensure Python has write permissions in the project directory

Confirm bloodlink.db appears after first run

Import errors

Verify dependencies are installed (pip list)

Port already in use

Change the port in app.py: app.run(debug=True, port=5001)

Chatbot not working

Verify provider and API key configuration in app.py

Ensure internet access for external APIs

Language files not loading

Confirm static/i18n/*.json files exist and are valid JSON
